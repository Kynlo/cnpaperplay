<h2>How to Play:</h2>
<p>This is a team vs team game.  Players are divided roughtly equally into a blue team and a red team, and one player on each team plays as the leader of that team.  Each team leader has their own book (though they can share a single book); the rest of the players can share the third "guessers" book.</p>
<p>A set of 25 words is provided to the group.  Only the team leaders know which of these words are considered to be blue team words, which are red team words, which are neutral (yellow) words, and which one word is the assasin (black) word.  Team leaders take turns providing a clue to their teammates to help them guess the words that belong to that team.</p>
<p>On their turn, the team leader says exactly one word and one number to their teammates, who must then collectively guess a single word that they think belongs to that team's color.  A clue word cannot be in the word list in any form and must relate to the meaning of the words.  The leader is allowed to spell the word.</p>
<p>After the teammates decide on their guess, the team leader looks up the color of the chosen word on their sheet and reports the result:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the color of the word is BLACK, the team loses the game immediately, and the other team wins.</li>
	<li>If the color of the word is YELLOW, the guess was wrong, but not fatally so, and the turn ends.  The next team leader will now take a turn.</li>
	<li>If the color of the word matches the team color, it is a correct guess.  The teammates may now, if they wish, make an additional guess (possibly releated to a previous clue) and repeat the resolution process above, with the restriction that the maximum number of guesses on a given turn are the number specified by the clue giver plus one.</li>
	<li>The game ends in a victory if a team manages to guess all of the words belonging to their color.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Remember:</b> Team leaders must never give any indication about whether a correct guess was the word they were thinking of when they gave the clue, and must refrain from any comments, inflections, or reactions that could assist the guesser.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Each game has a random starting team that must give the first clue.  That team will always have one more word that needs to be guessed than the other team.</p>
